# Simple Flashcard Web App

This repository contains the source code for a simple flashcard web application. It presents users with flashcards that can be flipped to reveal the corresponding translations of phrases. The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive user experience.

## Features
- **Flashcards**: The flashcards display a phrase in one language on one side and the translation in another language on the other side. When users hover over a flashcard, it flips to reveal the translation.
- **Random Phrases**: The app fetches phrases from a JSON file and displays them in a random order each time the page is loaded. This feature helps to enhance the learning process.
- **Information Icon**: Each flashcard contains an information icon in the top-left corner. When users click on this icon, a pop-up window displays additional information or a definition related to the phrase on the card.

## Usage
To use this web application, simply clone the repository, open the HTML file in your browser, and interact with the flashcards.

## Future Enhancements
The next phase of this project will focus on improving the user interface, adding more interactive elements, and expanding the phrase database.
